# Web-Scraping-Project-on-Tata-Cars-
I have successfully scraped detailed information on Tata car models and their available color variants from the provided URL, https://lnkd.in/gtRnhRVq. The scraping script, written in Python, utilizes requests and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and json to extract structured data embedded within a &lt;â€‹script> tag with the id __NEXT_DATA__.
